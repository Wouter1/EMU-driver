EMU-USB driver
=============

OSX driver for Creative Labs EMU USB

* Tested on Mavericks and Yosemite. Probably also works on other versions of OSX. 
* All sample rates are supported both for record and playback: 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4 and 192 kHz
* I can only test on EMU0404 USB as I have no other EMU devices. But users reported it works also on EMU0204 and Tracker Pre USB.
* Midi is not tested, no idea if it works (#23). 

Please notify me how my driver works on other EMU USB devices.
